Box Model
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept that describes how elements on a web page are structured and how their dimensions are calculated.
Each element is represented as a rectangular box, which consists of four main components:

1) Content: The innermost part of the box where text and images are displayed.
2) Padding: The space between the content and the border. It creates space inside the box.
3) Border: The edge of the box that surrounds the padding and content. It can have different styles, widths, and colors.
4) Margin: The outermost space that separates the element from other elements on the page. It creates space outside the box.

Different CSS selectors
1) Universal Selector (*): Selects all elements on the page.
2) Type Selector (element): Selects all elements of a specific type (e.g., div, p, h1).
3) Class Selector (.class): Selects all elements with a specific class attribute.
4) ID Selector (#id): Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
5) Attribute Selector ([attribute=value]): Selects elements based on the presence or value of an attribute.
6) Descendant Selector (ancestor descendant): Selects elements that are descendants of a specified ancestor element.
7) Child Selector (parent > child): Selects elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.
8) Adjacent Sibling Selector (element1 + element2): Selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified sibling element.
9) General Sibling Selector (element1 ~ element2): Selects all sibling elements that follow a specified sibling element.
10) Pseudo-class Selector (element:pseudo-class): Selects elements based on their state or position (e.g., :hover, :first-child).
11) Pseudo-element Selector (element::pseudo-element): Selects and styles specific parts of an element (e.g., ::before, ::after).

Sass vs Scss
Sass and SCSS are both syntaxes of the Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) preprocessor for CSS.

Sass
1) Indentation-Based Syntax: Sass uses indentation to define code blocks instead of curly braces and semicolons.
2) Concise Syntax: Sass has a more concise syntax, which can lead to shorter code.

SCSS
1) CSS-Compatible Syntax: SCSS is a superset of CSS, meaning that all valid CSS code is also valid SCSS code.
2) Familiar Syntax: SCSS uses curly braces and semicolons, making it more familiar to those who are used to writing CSS.

Reset CSS vs Normalize CSS

Reset CSS is a stylesheet that removes all default browser styling from HTML elements.
It sets all margins, paddings, borders, and font sizes to zero or a consistent baseline.
The goal is to create a clean slate for styling, ensuring that all browsers start with the same basic styles.

Normalize CSS, on the other hand, is a stylesheet that aims to make built-in browser styles
consistent across different browsers. Instead of removing all styles, it preserves useful default styles
while fixing inconsistencies and bugs in browser rendering. Normalize CSS provides a more balanced approach,
allowing developers to build upon a consistent foundation without losing the benefits of default styles.

border box vs content box
In CSS, the box-sizing property determines how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

content-box
This is the default value for box-sizing. When using content-box, the width and height properties
only apply to the content area of the element. Padding and borders are added outside of the specified width and height.

border-box
When using border-box, the width and height properties include the content area, padding, and borders.
This means that the total size of the element remains consistent, regardless of the padding or border size.

display: none vs visibility: hidden vs opacity: 0
display: none
1) The element is completely removed from the document flow.
2) It does not take up any space on the page.
3) It is not visible and cannot be interacted with.

visibility: hidden
1) The element is hidden but still takes up space in the document flow.
2) It is not visible, but it can still affect the layout of other elements.
3) It cannot be interacted with.

opacity: 0
1) The element is fully transparent but still takes up space in the document flow.
2) It is not visible, but it can still affect the layout of other elements.
3) It can still be interacted with, as it is still present in the DOM.

z index
The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap each other.
Elements with a higher z-index value are displayed in front of elements with a lower z-index value.

opacity
The opacity property in CSS controls the transparency level of an element.
It takes a value between 0 and 1, where 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.

flexbox vs grid
Flexbox and Grid are both CSS layout models used to create responsive and flexible web designs,
but they have different use cases and capabilities.

Flexbox
1) One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical).
2) Content-Driven: Flexbox is ideal for distributing space among items in a container, especially when the size of the items is unknown or dynamic.
3) Alignment and Distribution: Flexbox provides powerful alignment and distribution options for items within a container, such as centering, spacing, and wrapping.

Grid
1) Two-Dimensional Layout: Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.
2) Layout-Driven: Grid is ideal for creating complex layouts with defined rows and columns, where the overall structure is known in advance.
3) Explicit Positioning: Grid allows for explicit placement of items within the grid, making it easier to create complex designs with precise control over item positioning.

CSS Positioning
1) Static Positioning (position: static): This is the default positioning for all elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow.
2) Relative Positioning (position: relative): Elements are positioned relative to their normal position. You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to adjust their position.
3) Absolute Positioning (position: absolute): Elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static). If no such ancestor exists, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
4) Fixed Positioning (position: fixed): Elements are positioned relative to the viewport and remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled.
5) Sticky Positioning (position: sticky): Elements are treated as relative until they reach a specified scroll position, at which point they become fixed. This allows elements to "stick" to a position as you scroll.

CSS display properties
1) block: The element is displayed as a block-level element, taking up the full width available and starting on a new line.
2) inline: The element is displayed as an inline element, taking up only as much width as necessary and not starting on a new line.
3) inline-block: The element is displayed as an inline-level block container. It allows setting width and height while still flowing with text.
4) none: The element is not displayed at all (it is removed from the document flow).
5) flex: The element is displayed as a block-level flex container, allowing for flexible layouts using the Flexbox model.
6) grid: The element is displayed as a block-level grid container, allowing for two-dimensional layouts using the Grid model.
7) table: The element is displayed as a table, similar to the HTML <table> element.
8) list-item: The element is displayed as a list item, similar to the HTML <li> element.

box sizing
The box-sizing property in CSS determines how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
It can take two main values:
1) content-box: This is the default value. The width and height properties apply only to the content of the element. Padding and borders are added outside of the specified width and height.
2) border-box: The width and height properties include the content, padding, and borders. This means that the total size of the element remains consistent, regardless of the padding or border size.


flexbox properties
1) display: flex; - Defines a flex container.
2) flex-direction - Defines the direction of the flex items (row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse).
3) justify-content - Aligns flex items along the main axis (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly).
4) align-items - Aligns flex items along the cross axis (flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, stretch).
5) flex-wrap - Controls whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines (nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse).
6) align-content - Aligns flex lines when there is extra space in the cross axis (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, stretch).
7) flex-grow - Defines the ability of a flex item to grow if necessary.
8) flex-shrink - Defines the ability of a flex item to shrink if necessary.
9) flex-basis - Defines the default size of a flex item before the remaining space is distributed.
10) order - Defines the order of flex items within the flex container.
