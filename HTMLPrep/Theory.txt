async vs defer
async and defer are attributes for script tags in HTML that help control when and how Javascipt files 
are loaded and executed - improving page performance.

async downloads the script in parallel(asynchronously) without blocking HTML parsing, but executes it immediately after
download before HTML parsing is done

<script src="script.js" async></script>
Order is not guaranteed if multiple async scripts exist.

defer also downloads the script asynchronously but executes it only after the HTML is fully parsed(rightBefore DOMContentLoaded).
<script src="script.js" defer></script>

Order is preserved (executed in the order they appear).

prefetch vs preload vs preconnect vs prerender

preconnect
Tell the browser to establish early connections(DNS lookup, TCP handshake, TLS negotiation) to a domain before any request is
made.

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

dns-prefetch
Resolve domain's DNS early-- faster but weaker than preconnect.

<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com">
No TCP or TLS setup (unlike preconnect).

preload
Tell the browser this resource is needed now -- fetch it early and with high priority
<link rel="preload" href="/css/main.css" as="style">
<link rel="preload" href="/js/app.js" as="script">
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/custom.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>

prefetch
Tell the browser to fetch resources in the background(low priority) for future navigations

<link rel="prefetch" href="/next-page.js" as="script">
Loaded in idle time, cached for later use.

prerender
Tells the browser to fully render a future page in the background. When the user navigates there -- it appears instantly

<link rel="prerender" href="https://example.com/next-page">

local storage vs session storage
Local Storage
1) Data Persistence: Data stored in local storage persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
2) Storage Limit: Typically has a larger storage limit (usually around 5-10 MB per domain).
3) Scope: Data is scoped to the entire origin (protocol + domain + port) and is accessible across all tabs and windows of the same origin.

Session Storage
1) Data Persistence: Data stored in session storage is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.
2) Storage Limit: Typically has a smaller storage limit (usually around 5 MB per domain).
3) Scope: Data is scoped to the specific tab or window and is not accessible across different tabs or windows, even if they share the same origin.
